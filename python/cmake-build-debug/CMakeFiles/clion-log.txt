CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindPythonExtensions.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "PythonExtensions", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "PythonExtensions"
  with any of the following names:

    PythonExtensionsConfig.cmake
    pythonextensions-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "PythonExtensions" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "PythonExtensions_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "PythonExtensions" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
